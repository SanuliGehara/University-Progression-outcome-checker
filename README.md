# University Progression Outcome Predictor
This program is implemented by using Python to predict the progression outcomes of each student. The program comes in two versions, tailored for both university staff and students, to determine the progression outcome. In the staff version, the program allows the user to enter module marks and predict outcomes repeatedly. 

In contrast, the student version gets the module marks and predicts the progression outcome once. For both versions, the histogram will be displayed. The histogram includes the progression outcomes according to the data entered during the program run. Used the graphycs.py module to display the histogram.
